# adastral-devs
Adastral Devs is a monthly event for everyone on Adastral Park who's interested in code.

Events usually comprise one talk, some Q&A, and healthy discussion.

Things we try to be:
- Regular (or it'll fizzle out)
- Short (people have work to do)
- Macro (loads of languages used on site)
- Lighthearted (because Adastral Park is already serious enough)
- Inclusive (because it's 2018)

## Wednesday 18th July 2018
### Hubble Room
The inaugural Adastral Devs meetup.
Chris Waters from Staylists gave a talk entitled [Evocative Naming](slides/1-evocative-naming.pdf).
